# __Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct__

## __Our Pledge__

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## __Our Standards__

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## __Our Responsibilities__

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## __Our Oath__

### __The Programmer's Oath__

In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers,

__I Promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement:__

* I will not produce harmful code.
* The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.
* I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.
* I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.
* I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
* I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
* I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.
* I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.
* I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

## __Our ways of working__

### __Manifesto for Agile Software Development__

We are uncovering better ways of developing  
software by doing it and helping others do it.  
Through this work we have come to value:  

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
Working software over comprehensive documentation  
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
Responding to change over following a plan  


That is, while there is value in the items on  
the right, we value the items on the left more.

## __Our guiding principles__

### __The Zen of Python__

The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 __"guiding principles"__ for writing computer programs that influence the design of the python programming language. As a python programmer this is expected from the group to keep these in mind while developing any software component.

_Beautiful is better than ugly._  
_Explicit is better than implicit._  
_Simple is better than complex._  
_Complex is better than complicated._  
_Flat is better than nested._  
_Sparse is better than dense._  
_Readability counts._  
_Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules._  
_Although practicality beats purity._  
_Errors should never pass silently._  
_Unless explicitly silenced._  
_In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess._  
_There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it._  
_Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch._  
_Now is better than never._  
_Although never is often better than `*right*` now._  
_If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea._  
_If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea._  
_Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!_  

## __Scope__

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## __Enforcement__

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at <code owner email address>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
